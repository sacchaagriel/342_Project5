Project 5. Simple 4 player game using Server and Clients. 


**Game: Mystery Number**

**Objective:** Be the first player to correctly guess the mystery number picked by the server. 

**Rules/Gameplay:** 

  The server waits for at least 4 players to connect before starting the game. A game cannot start with less than 4 players.
  However, any player may leave at any time they wish once the game has started. In such a case, the remaining players will
  continue to play.
  
  Once there are 4 players connected, the server will choose a random number from 0-50.
  
  Once the 4th player joins, all players can begin guessing numbers. All players will see a list (updated 
  in real time) of all the numbers that have already been guessed by either him/herself or any other players in
  the game. The first player to correctly guess the mystery number wins the game.
  
  Once a player has correctly guessed the mystery number and won, the game ends and all other players see the mystery number
  displayed on their respective user interfaces.
  
  Once the game is over, the players either have the option to QUIT or PLAY AGAIN.
  
  Speed and process of elimination are key! Good luck :)
  
  **Enjoy the game!**
